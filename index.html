		  		<p>Sheryl: 
						I had sleep apnea. It really effected my life a lot.  I didnt know how bad it was till I fell asleep driving. 
		  			I dont remember those moments till my daughter screamed and help me  get out of a bad situation. I thought maybe I could call the doctor if
					something is wrong. After my visit, I now wake up more refreshed and I just have more confidence.</p>
