		  		<p>Chris Jones: 
						I had sleep apnea. I couldnt go to sleep for months. It was hard with all the snoring for me to sleep. When I visited Sweet
		  				Dreams Sleep Center, they did a study on me and had me sleeping in weeks. They did a good job with the customer serivce and 
		  				and were very quick with the results as well. Im glad I went to the doctors to get this resolved. Now I sleep way better 
		  				and alot faster now thanks to Huy and his team.</p>
