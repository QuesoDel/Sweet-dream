		      <h3>What Is Sleep Apnea</h3>
		     <p>Sleep apnea a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Sleep apnea can affect anyone, even children. But certain factors increase your risk. If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea.</p>
		     <p>Sleep apnea is caused by many things including excess weight, neck circumference, or a narrowed airway. You can be more predisposed to sleep apnea if you are male, older, have a family history, smoke, have nasal congestion, take certain medications, and many more. </p>
      
			  <h4>Main Types of Sleep Apnea</h4>
				  <ul>
  					<li>Obstructive Sleep Apnea - the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax</li>
					<li>Central Sleep Apnea - which occurs when your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing</li>
					<li>Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome - also known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, which occurs when someone has both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea</li>
				  </ul>
       </section>

       <section>
			  <h3>Sleep Apnea Causes</h3>
			  	 <ul>
  					<li>Obstructive Sleep Apnea - This occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax. These muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula), the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue.</li>
			  		<li>Central Sleep Apnea - This less common form of sleep apnea occurs when your brain fails to transmit signals to your breathing muscles. This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period. You might awaken with shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep.</li>
	          <li>Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome - If the person has both constructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.</li>
				  </ul>

		     <h3>What's New Out There</h3>
			     <p>New machines are constantly coming out and we're adapting the new technology all the time. There are many researches out the who are dedicated to focus and study on sleep apnea. Studies for sleep, medicine, machines, trials, and more are getting improved on constantly.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>CPAP Machine</h3>
        <p>Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) uses a machine to help a person who has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) breathe more easily during sleep. A CPAP machine increases air pressure in your throat so that your airway doesn't collapse when you breathe in. When you use CPAP, your bed partner may sleep better too.</p>
	      <p>You use CPAP at home every night while you sleep. The CPAP machine will have one of the following:</p>
	      <ul>
  		  <li>A mask that covers your nose and mouth.</li>
		    <li>A mask that covers your nose onlyâ€”called nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or NCPAP (this type of mask is most common).</li>
	    	<li>Prongs that fit into your nose.</li>
	     </ul>
	<h3>What To Expect After Treatment</h3>
	      <p>It may take time for you to become comfortable with using CPAP. If you can't get used to it, talk to your doctor. You might be able to try another type of mask or make other adjustments.</p>
	      <h4>CPAP is effective for treating sleep apnea:</h4>
	      <ul>
  		<li>CPAP is better than other nonsurgical methods for treating obstructive sleep apnea.</li>
		<li>Research shows that CPAP decreases daytime sleepiness, especially in those who have moderate to severe sleep apnea</li>
		<li>People who use CPAP for longer times each night (around 7 hours) have less daytime sleepiness and depression and fewer heart issues than people who use CPAP for shorter times (around 5 hours).</li>
	     </ul>
