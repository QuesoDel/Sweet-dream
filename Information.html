		      <h3>What Is Sleep Apnea</h3>
		     <p>Sleep apnea a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Sleep apnea can affect anyone, even children. But certain factors increase your risk. If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea.</p>
		     <p>Sleep apnea is caused by many things including excess weight, neck circumference, or a narrowed airway. You can be more predisposed to sleep apnea if you are male, older, have a family history, smoke, have nasal congestion, take certain medications, and many more. </p>
			  <h4>Main Types of Sleep Apnea</h4>
				  <dl>
  					<dt>Obstructive Sleep Apnea</dt>
  						<dd>- the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax</dd>
					<dt>Central Sleep Apnea</dt>
  						<dd>- which occurs when your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing</dd>
					<dt>Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome</dt>
  						<dd>- also known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, which occurs when someone has both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea</dd>
				  </dl>
			  <h3>Sleep Apnea Causes</h3>
			  
			  	   <dl>
  					<dt>Obstructive Sleep Apnea</dt>
  						<dd>- This occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax. These muscles support the soft palate, the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula), the tonsils, the side walls of the throat and the tongue.</dd>
					<dt>Central Sleep Apnea</dt>
  						<dd>- This less common form of sleep apnea occurs when your brain fails to transmit signals to your breathing muscles. This means that you make no effort to breathe for a short period. You might awaken with shortness of breath or have a difficult time getting to sleep or staying asleep</dd>
					<dt>Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome</dt>
  						<dd>- If the person has both constructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.</dd>

		     <h3>What Is A Sleep Study</h3>
			   <p>A sleep study is a test that records the activity of the body during sleep. There are five main types of sleep studies that use different methods to test for different sleep characteristics and disorders.	These include simple sleep studies, polysomnography, multiple sleep latency tests (MLTs), maintenance of wakefulness tests (MWTs), and home sleep tests (HSTs). Here at the Sweet Dreams Sleep Center, we will help you determine the best course of action for your individual needs.</p>
